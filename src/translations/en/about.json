    "content": "My name is Maksim Georgiev Marinov and I have decided to change the course of my life by entering a new stage of web development after years of working in the hotel industry. During my time in hospitality, I gained skills such as attention to detail, effective communication, and the ability to solve problems under pressure. Now I am in a new stage of exploring the incredible world of web development through intensive training at Ironhack Bootcamp. My experience in hospitality has taught me the importance of teamwork, adaptability and creativity, qualities that I will try to apply in my new path in web development. I am happy with the opportunity to merge my strong interest in web development with my dedication to customer service. As I step into this new chapter, I am excited to contribute and collaborate on exciting projects. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about my trip. I look forward to sharing more with you in the future!"
